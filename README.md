## My WP Docker scripts

This is a basic docker-compose setup that spins up a new Wordpress docker stack and
automates the install process. This is purely to be used as a dev environment.

### Details

- to mount plugins you're working on locally in Wordpress, adjust the `PLUGIN_DEV_DIRECTORY` value to point to an absolute local path.
- bin/no-bindings.sh runs an empty WP install that does not mount your specified plugins directory.
- bin/start.sh runs/builds docker-compose'd wordpress environment.
- bin/reset.sh stops/rms containers and volumes. **Take care, this will delete all your docker containers locally**
- to import some test data include the env variable `TEST_DATA=true` like: `TEST_DATA=true ./bin/start.sh` (you will need wc-smooth-generator in your plugin directory to generate test data)

### TODO

- A reset just for the containers/images generated by this project
